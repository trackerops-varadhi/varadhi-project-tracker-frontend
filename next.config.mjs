   * SAME-ORIGIN API PROXY — this is what makes authentication work at all.
   *
   * THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
   * The frontend is served from *.vercel.app and the API from *.onrender.com.
   * Those are different registrable domains, so an auth cookie set by the API
   * is a THIRD-PARTY cookie from the browser's point of view. Safari (iOS and
   * macOS) has blocked all third-party cookies by default since 2020, Chrome
   * blocks them on Android/incognito and under common privacy settings, and
   * managed corporate browsers usually block them by policy.
   *
   * The server was doing everything correctly — HttpOnly, Secure,
   * SameSite=None, correct CORS, no Domain attribute. It made no difference:
   * SameSite=None makes a cookie ELIGIBLE to be sent cross-site, it does not
   * make a browser willing to STORE it. Login returned 200, the browser threw
   * the Set-Cookie away, the next request had no credential, and the user was
   * bounced back to the login page. It appeared to work only in browsers that
   * still permit third-party cookies.
   *
   * Cookie-attribute tuning cannot fix this, and neither can a shared parent
   * domain: vercel.app and onrender.com are both on the Public Suffix List, so
   * Domain=.vercel.app is forbidden and there is no common ancestor.
   *
   * HOW THIS FIXES IT
   * Requests go to /api/* on THIS origin; Vercel proxies them to the backend
   * server-side. The browser sees one origin, so the auth cookies are
   * first-party and every browser stores them normally. Nothing about the
   * security model changes: still HttpOnly, still Secure, same rotation,
   * revocation and CSRF guard.
   *
   * NOTE: `proxy.js`'s matcher already excludes /api, so Next middleware does
   * not intercept these.
   *
   * REGRESSION HISTORY: this entire function was silently dropped by an
   * auto-merge of origin/feature/ui-suhailar (merge commit 72a6c87) — that
   * branch's next.config.mjs never had it, git's 3-way merge saw no
   * line-level overlap with HEAD's version and resolved the file without a
   * conflict, and the result was a net deletion with nothing flagged for
   * review. Caught by diffing the merged tree against the incoming branch
   * file-by-file, not by the conflict markers (there were none). If this
   * block disappears again, every API call in production will silently 404
   * (same-origin requests to /api/* with no rewrite to the real backend).
