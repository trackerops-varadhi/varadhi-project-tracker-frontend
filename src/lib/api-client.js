/*
 * THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN THIS FILE.

 * The dashboard fires many requests at once. When the 15-minute access token
 * expires, they all 401 together. The previous implementation called
 * /auth/refresh from each one independently, and with refresh-token rotation
 * that is fatal: the first call rotates the token and revokes the old one, and
 * every other in-flight call then presents a token the server has just killed.
 * The backend's reuse detection treats a replayed refresh token as a stolen
 * credential and revokes EVERY session for the user — so a perfectly normal
 * page load would sign the user out of all their devices.
 *
 * The fix is to let exactly one refresh be in flight. Every other 401 awaits
 * the same promise and then retries. The backend also has a 15-second grace
 * window as a second line of defence, but correctness should not depend on it.
 *
 * The promise is cleared in `finally` so a failed refresh does not poison
 * subsequent attempts with a permanently rejected promise.
