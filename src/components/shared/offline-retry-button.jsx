/**
 * "Try again" for the offline fallback page.
 *
 * The service worker serves /offline in response to a failed navigation, but
 * the address bar still shows the URL the user asked for. So a reload retries
 * that exact request — a hardcoded link to /dashboard would silently discard
 * where they were going.
 *
 * Rendered as a real <a href> pointing at the current path, with onClick
 * upgrading it to location.reload(). That keeps it functional before hydration
 * and gives the browser a sensible target on middle-click, while avoiding a
 * Next client-side navigation (which would be served over the same dead
 * network and fail without ever hitting the SW).
